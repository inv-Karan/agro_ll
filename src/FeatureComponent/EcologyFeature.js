                When the baby greens are ready for harvest, timing and temperature rule the day. And at the perfect moment, the race begins. During the hotter summer months, Earthbound Farm laborers start their day at 3 a.m., harvesting the baby leaves before the temperature reaches 80 degrees, at which point the leaves become too soft to pick. Stan Pura, director of farm operations and one of Earthbound Farm's partners, designed a unique baby-lettuce harvester that picks easily-torn baby greens quickly and consistently. Working in a pattern of overlapping rings, eight people variously direct and drive the machine and put the mechanically picked greens into plastic totes. The harvesting machine has a continuous looping blade that goes through a sharpener with each rotation. After the machine cuts the leaves, it blows them onto a mesh grid that allows small leaves and rocks to fall through.
